## Comments on the code.


Something i never liked about record wild cards was that it  simply broke the encapsulation principle and so never got around
to using it. Though the cost of not using them is verbosity, on the other hand, it hides the complexity of a structure. I am not
really convinced that this was the right approach. Well, we just move with it because it shortens the code. 

```
   • No instance for (Num (Maybe Integer))
        arising from the literal ‘0’
    • In the second argument of ‘(.!=)’, namely ‘0’
      In a stmt of a 'do' block:
        __confirmations <- o .:? "confirmations" .!= 0
      In the expression:
        do { __amount <- o .: "amount";
             __confirmations <- o .:? "confirmations" .!= 0;
             __blockHash <- o .: "blockhash";
             __blockTime <- o .: "blocktime";
             .... }

```
